                <li>
                  remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the

                <li>
                  transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the

              termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded
              materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed
              format.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>

              merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
              non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of
              rights. Further, Chiara Mendolia does not warrant or make any
              representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

            inability to use the materials on Chiara Mendolia's Internet site,
            even if Chiara Mendolia or a Chiara Mendolia authorized
            representative has been notified orally or in writing of the

            to you.
