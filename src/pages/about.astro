          <p>
            I'm a 24 graphic designer from Lausanne, Switzerland. I graduated
            from the school eracom on June 2024. I’m looking forward to start my
            professional life in Switzerland or abroad. I’m open-minded for
            every of your collaboration or job offer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creative. Organised. Passionate. Independent. Attentive. Driven.
            Hard worker.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had the chance to accomplish some graphic and illustration works
            for Swiss small buisnesses. I’ve had a work experience in Tokyo
            during a five-month internship at Drill Inc. by the side of the
            creative and art director Miharu Matsunaga. I’m now the proud
            graphic designer of the Japanese art project 'Living Kanji' driven
            by Miharu Matsunaga and copywritten by Adam Gothelf from Dentsu Inc.
            I've also spent a three-month internship in Taipei at the Taiwanese
            graphic design studio Idealform.co.
