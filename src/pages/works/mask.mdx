That photographic projet was to deliver 3 portrait with a common theme : the mask. 
As large as is that term, we had to think about what kind of mask we wanted to show up.
Me and my classmate are fascinating by the 60’s aesthetic and that’s how we went for that blue vintagelooked woman in different situations. The purpose was to illustrate the 60’s facsination for the alien. 
We imagine how a front page can announce that alien will cohabited with humans in a close future but from the 60’s. 
The mix between future and old-fashionned aesthetic was chose to create a confusion and humor.
