            Il coraggio siciliano

The sicilian bravery to drink very cold.

</p>

       As the exercice was to brand a local beer of the country of our choice I went for my second nationality : sicilian (hush.. I know it’s italian but my proud ass can’t speak it up).

I tried to avoid cliché representation of italian so I use the bond between the sicilians and the sea which is central in that community. Indeed the sea is a common source of food but also a place whom memories arre created.
The illustration has been realised by my passionate hands with Micron Pen black and then digitize and colorize.
