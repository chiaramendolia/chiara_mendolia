Paper collage based on «Les Vents de Vancouver» by Kenneth White. 
The instructions were to illustrates using all techniques we want the text of Kenneth White about his journey in Canada. Throught the reading, we learn a lot of different aspect of the canadian nature but also the canadians history. 
I tried to illustrate the passages of the text that induced me an mental image almost instantly. That’s that first irealistic picture my mind made that I wanted to create with a collage. The collage technique allowed me to play with forms, size scales, textures to compose an irrealistic and exagerated illustration.
