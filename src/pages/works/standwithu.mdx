            No more war propaganda, make it viral!

As we all know 2023 was threaten with military attacks, national threats and wars preparation. 
That stressful moment inspiring one of my teacher and we started to work on an black and white no war logo. 
I chose to illustrate my support for the countries that are victims of military attacks. My S and U logo symbolize union and  strengh but also for giving hope for the hard times some countries are going through. 
I used my logo to create an poster that can be put up in town as an propaganda of peace.
